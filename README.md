# CS-4753-Application-Security
Fall 2018

Primary Goal: Take an image and crop it into a square

All projects are built using Python 2.7

For AppSec_HW1.py please insure you have Python Pillow installed

Use command "pip install pillow"

When running application...

Will prompt for image file where you provide the filepath to the image for cropping

Will show the cropped image and save a copy of the cropped image in the same directory as the python file under "crop.png"

Early performance improvements include:
 - checking if the input file type matches a compatible file type for Pillow
